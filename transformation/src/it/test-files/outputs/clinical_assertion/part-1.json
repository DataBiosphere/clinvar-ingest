The p.Cys282Tyr variant affects HFE protein activity by preventing the formation of a disulfide bridge in the alpha-3 domain, which impairs the beta-2-microglobulin interaction and prevents the protein from reaching the cell surface (Feder et al. 1997). The p.Cys282Tyr variant has a frequency of 5% to 7% in Caucasians (Press et al. 2016) and is reported at a frequency of 0.06407 in the European American population of the Exome Sequencing Project.
