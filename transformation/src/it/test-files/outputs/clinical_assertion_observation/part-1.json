In a random sample of 1,438 subjects stratified according to HFE genotype, including all 203 C282Y homozygotes (of whom 108 were women and 95 were men), they obtained clinical and biochemical data, including 2 sets of iron measurements performed 12 years apart. Disease related to iron overload was defined as documented iron overload and one or more of the following conditions: cirrhosis, liver fibrosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, elevated aminotransferase levels, physician-diagnosed symptomatic hemochromatosis, and arthropathy of the second and third metacarpophalangeal joints. The proportion of C282Y homozygotes with documented iron overload-related disease was 28.4% for men and 1.2% for women. Only 1 non-C282Y homozygote (a compound heterozygote with his63 to asp) had documented iron overload-related disease. Male C282Y homozygotes with a serum ferritin level of 1,000 micrograms per liter or more were more likely to report fatigue, use of arthritis medicine, and a history of liver disease than were men who had the wildtype gene. Waalen and Beutler (2008) and Rienhoff (2008) commented that the study by Allen et al.

The authors examined the interaction between the C2 variant of the TF gene (190000.0004) and the C282Y allele of the HFE gene, the most common basis of hemochromatosis, as risk factors for developing AD. The results showed that each of the 2 variants was associated with an increased risk of AD only in the presence of the other. Neither allele alone had any effect. Carriers of both variants were at 5 times greater risk of AD compared with all others. Furthermore, carriers of these 2 alleles plus APOE4 (see 107741) were at still higher risk of AD: of the 14 carriers of the 3 variants identified in this study, 12 had AD and 2 had mild cognitive impairment. Robson et al.
