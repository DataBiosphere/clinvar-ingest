Such LVH occurs in a non-dilated ventricle in the absence of other cardiac or systemic disease capable of producing the observed magnitude of increased LV wall thickness, such as pressure overload (e.g., long-standing hypertension, aortic stenosis) or storage\/infiltrative disorders (e.g., Fabry disease, amyloidosis). The clinical manifestations of HCM range from asymptomatic LVH to progressive heart failure to sudden cardiac death (SCD), and vary from individual to individual even within the same family. Common symptoms include shortness of breath (particularly with exertion), chest pain, palpitations, orthostasis, presyncope, and syncope. Most often the LVH of HCM becomes apparent during adolescence or young adulthood, although it may also develop late in life, in infancy, or in childhood."}}],"Citation":[{"@Type":"review","@Abbrev":"GeneReviews","ID":[{"@Source":"PubMed","$":"20301559"},{"@Source":"BookShelf","$":"NBK1385"}]},{"@Type":"review","@Abbrev":"GeneReviews","ID":[{"@Source":"PubMed","$":"20301725"},{"@Source":"BookShelf","$":"NBK1768"}]},{"@Type":"Translational\/Evidence-based","@Abbrev":"EuroGenetest, 2011","ID":{"@Source":"PubMed","$":"21267010"}},{"@Type":"Recommendation","@Abbrev":"ACMG, 2013","ID":{"@Source":"PubMed","$":"23788249"}},{"@Type":"practice guideline","@Abbrev":"AHRQ, 2013","ID":{"@Source":"BookShelf","$":"NBK248310"}},{"@Type":"practice guideline","@Abbrev":"ESC, 2014","ID":{"@Source":"PubMed","$":"25173338"}},{"@Type":"Recommendation","@Abbrev":"ACMG, 2015","ID":{"@Source":"PubMed","$":"25356965"}},{"@Type":"Recommendation","@Abbrev":"ACMG, 2016","ID":[{"@Source":"PubMed","$":"27854360"},{"@Source":"DOI","$":"10.1038\/gim.2016.190"}]}],"XRef":[{"@ID":"C3495498","@DB":"MedGen"},{"@Type":"MIM","@ID":"192600","@DB":"OMIM"}]}}}}},"ClinicalAssertionList":{"ClinicalAssertion":{"@ID":"2402552","@DateCreated":"2020-04-12","@DateLastUpdated":"2020-04-15","@SubmissionDate":"2020-02-06","ClinVarSubmissionID":{"@localKey":"4405868|MedGen:C3495498","@submittedAssembly":"GRCh37"},"ClinVarAccession":{"@Accession":"SCV001236871","@Type":"SCV","@Version":"1","@SubmitterName":"Invitae","@OrgID":"500031","@OrganizationCategory":"laboratory"},"RecordStatus":{"$":"current"},"ReviewStatus":{"$":"criteria provided, single submitter"},"Interpretation":{"@DateLastEvaluated":"2019-12-16","Description":{"$":"Uncertain significance"},"Comment":{"$":"This sequence change replaces glycine with serine at codon 75 of the MYLK2 protein (p.Gly75Ser). The glycine residue is moderately conserved and there is a small physicochemical difference between glycine and serine. This variant is present in population databases (rs746102821, ExAC 0.02%). This variant has not been reported in the literature in individuals with MYLK2-related conditions. Algorithms developed to predict the effect of missense changes on protein structure and function output the following: SIFT: \"Tolerated\"; PolyPhen-2: \"Benign\"; Align-GVGD: \"Class C0\". The serine amino acid residue is found in multiple mammalian species, suggesting that this missense change does not adversely affect protein function. These predictions have not been confirmed by published functional studies and their clinical significance is uncertain. In summary, the available evidence is currently insufficient to determine the role of this variant in disease. Therefore, it has been classified as a Variant of Uncertain Significance."}},"Assertion":{"$":"variation to disease"},"AttributeSet":{"Attribute":{"@Type":"AssertionMethod","$":"Invitae Variant Classification Sherloc (09022015)"},"Citation":{"ID":{"@Source":"PubMed","$":"28492532"}}},"ObservedInList":{"ObservedIn":{"Sample":{"Origin":{"$":"germline"},"Species":{"@TaxonomyId":"9606","$":"human"},"AffectedStatus":{"$":"unknown"}},"Method":{"MethodType":{"$":"clinical testing"}},"ObservedData":{"Attribute":{"@Type":"Description","$":"not provided"}}}},"SimpleAllele":{"GeneList":{"Gene":{"@Symbol":"MYLK2"}},"VariantType":{"$":"Variation"},"AttributeSet":{"Attribute":{"@Type":"HGVS","$":"NM_033118.3:c.223G>A"}}},"TraitSet":{"@Type":"Disease","Trait":{"@Type":"Disease","Name":{"ElementValue":{"@Type":"Preferred","$":"Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 1"}},"XRef":{"@DB":"MedGen","@ID":"C3495498","@Type":"CUI"}}},"SubmissionNameList":{"SubmissionName":{"$":"SUB6933801"}}}},"TraitMappingList":{"TraitMapping":{"@ClinicalAssertionID":"2402552","@TraitType":"Disease","@MappingType":"Name","@MappingValue":"Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 1","@MappingRef":"Preferred","MedGen":{"@CUI":"C3495498","@Name":"Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 1"}}}}}}
