disease. It occurs when heart (cardiac) muscle becomes thin and weakened in at least one chamber of the heart, causing the open area of the chamber to become enlarged (dilated). As a result, the heart is unable to pump blood as efficiently as usual. To compensate, the heart attempts to increase the amount of blood being pumped through the heart, leading to further thinning and weakening of the cardiac muscle. Over time, this condition results in heart failure.It usually takes many years for symptoms of familial dilated cardiomyopathy to cause health problems. They typically begin in mid-adulthood, but can occur at any time from infancy to late adulthood. Signs and symptoms of familial dilated cardiomyopathy can include an irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia), shortness of breath (dyspnea), extreme tiredness (fatigue), fainting episodes (syncope), and swelling of the legs and feet. In some cases, the first sign of the disorder is sudden cardiac death. The severity of the condition varies among affected individuals, even in members of the same family."},"XRef":{"@ID":"familial-dilated-cardiomyopathy","@DB":"Genetics Home Reference"}}],"Citation":[{"@Type":"review","@Abbrev":"GeneReviews","ID":[{"@Source":"PubMed","$":"20301486"},{"@Source":"BookShelf","$":"NBK1309"}]},{"@Type":"review","ID":{"@Source":"PubMed","$":"16839424"}},{"@Type":"practice guideline","@Abbrev":"AHRQ, 2013","ID":{"@Source":"BookShelf","$":"NBK248310"}},{"@Type":"Recommendation","@Abbrev":"HRS\/EHRA, 2012","ID":{"@Source":"PubMed","$":"21810866"}}],"XRef":[{"@ID":"217604","@DB":"Orphanet"},{"@ID":"C0007193","@DB":"MedGen"},{"@ID":"EFO_0000407","@DB":"EFO"},{"@Type":"primary","@ID":"HP:0001644","@DB":"Human Phenotype Ontology"},{"@Type":"secondary","@ID":"HP:0001725","@DB":"Human Phenotype Ontology"},{"@Type":"secondary","@ID":"HP:0005159","@DB":"Human Phenotype Ontology"},{"@Type":"secondary","@ID":"HP:0200130","@DB":"Human Phenotype Ontology"}]}}}}},"ClinicalAssertionList":{"ClinicalAssertion":{"@ID":"1853642","@DateCreated":"2019-08-10","@DateLastUpdated":"2019-08-15","@SubmissionDate":"2019-03-28","ClinVarSubmissionID":{"@localKey":"4723086|MedGen:C0007193","@submittedAssembly":"GRCh37"},"ClinVarAccession":{"@Accession":"SCV000959355","@Type":"SCV","@Version":"1","@SubmitterName":"Invitae","@OrgID":"500031","@OrganizationCategory":"laboratory"},"RecordStatus":{"$":"current"},"ReviewStatus":{"$":"criteria provided, single submitter"},"Interpretation":{"@DateLastEvaluated":"2018-08-14","Description":{"$":"Uncertain significance"},"Comment":{"$":"This sequence change replaces valine with leucine at codon 22 of the TXNRD2 protein (p.Val22Leu). The valine residue is weakly conserved and there is a small physicochemical difference between valine and leucine. While this variant is not present in population databases, the frequency information is unreliable, as metrics indicate poor data quality at this position in the ExAC database. This variant has not been reported in the literature in individuals with TXNRD2-related disease. Algorithms developed to predict the effect of missense changes on protein structure and function (SIFT, PolyPhen-2, Align-GVGD) all suggest that this variant is likely to be tolerated, but these predictions have not been confirmed by published functional studies and their clinical significance is uncertain. In summary, the available evidence is currently insufficient to determine the role of this variant in disease. Therefore, it has been classified as a Variant of Uncertain Significance."}},"Assertion":{"$":"variation to disease"},"AttributeSet":{"Attribute":{"@Type":"AssertionMethod","$":"Invitae Variant Classification Sherloc (09022015)"},"Citation":{"ID":{"@Source":"PubMed","$":"28492532"}}},"ObservedInList":{"ObservedIn":{"Sample":{"Origin":{"$":"germline"},"Species":{"@TaxonomyId":"9606","$":"human"},"AffectedStatus":{"$":"unknown"}},"Method":{"MethodType":{"$":"clinical testing"}},"ObservedData":{"Attribute":{"@Type":"Description","$":"not provided"}}}},"SimpleAllele":{"GeneList":{"Gene":{"@Symbol":"TXNRD2"}},"VariantType":{"$":"Variation"},"AttributeSet":{"Attribute":{"@Type":"HGVS","$":"NM_006440.4:c.64G>T"}}},"TraitSet":{"@Type":"Disease","Trait":{"@Type":"Disease","Name":{"ElementValue":{"@Type":"Preferred","$":"Primary dilated cardiomyopathy"}},"XRef":{"@DB":"MedGen","@ID":"C0007193","@Type":"CUI"}}},"SubmissionNameList":{"SubmissionName":{"$":"SUB5371970"}}}},"TraitMappingList":{"TraitMapping":{"@ClinicalAssertionID":"1853642","@TraitType":"Disease","@MappingType":"Name","@MappingValue":"Primary dilated cardiomyopathy","@MappingRef":"Preferred","MedGen":{"@CUI":"C0007193","@Name":"Primary dilated cardiomyopathy"}}}}}}
