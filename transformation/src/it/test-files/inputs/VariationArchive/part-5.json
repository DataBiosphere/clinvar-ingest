They noted that a key question is why there is a variation in severity of iron loading in HH that is haplotype-related when the mutation is identical in all haplotypes tested. Jazwinska et al.

Disease penetrance for the p.Cys282Tyr variant carriers is variable (Beutler et al. 2002; Pedersen et al. 2009; Gurrin et al. 2009), with homozygotes being at a greater risk for iron overload than compound heterozygotes (Seckington et al. 2015; Gallego et al. 2015). The p.Cys282Tyr variant affects HFE protein activity by preventing the formation of a disulfide bridge in the alpha-3 domain, which impairs the beta-2-microglobulin interaction and prevents the protein from reaching the cell surface (Feder et al. 1997). The p.Cys282Tyr variant has a frequency of 5% to 7% in Caucasians (Press et al. 2016) and is reported at a frequency of 0.06407 in the European American population of the Exome Sequencing Project. This allele frequency is high but is consistent with estimates of disease prevalence and reduced penetrance. Based on the collective evidence, the p.Cys282Tyr variant is classified as pathogenic for hereditary hemochromatosis.

The cysteine residue is highly conserved and there is a large physicochemical difference between cysteine and tyrosine. This variant is present in population databases (rs1800562, ExAC 5%). This is a common, low penetrance variant that is known to contribute to hemochromatosis when homozygous or present with a second pathogenic allele in HFE. As many as 90% of individuals of European descent who are affected with hemochromatosis are homozygous for this variant (PMID: 16132052, 26153218, 26365338). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 9). Experimental studies have shown that this missense change disrupts a disulfide bond in the Å’Â±3 domain of the HFE protein and impairs interaction of HFE with beta2-microglobulin, resulting in a block in intracellular transport and loss of cell surface expression of the Cys282Tyr variant protein (PMID: 9162021, 9356458).
