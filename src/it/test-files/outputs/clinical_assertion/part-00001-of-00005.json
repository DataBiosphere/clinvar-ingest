The arginine residue is highly conserved and there is a moderate physicochemical difference between arginine and tryptophan. This variant is present in population databases (rs119476050, ExAC 0.001%). This variant has been reported in several individuals affected with hereditary spastic paraplegia (PMID: 20932283, 24451228, 19459885, 16401858). This variant has also been reported to segregate with hereditary spastic paraplegia in several families, however, it has been identified in unaffected family members due to adult onset and incomplete penetrance (PMID: 15184642, 24417445, 23483706, 26671083). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 4352). This missense change is located in a region of the ATL1 protein where a significant number of previously reported ATL1 missense mutations are found (PMID: 15596607, 20932283, 25454648, 23483706, 21336785, 19768483). These observations suggest that a previously unreported missense substitution within this region may affect protein function, but experiments have not been done to test this possibility. Algorithms developed to predict the effect of missense changes on protein structure and function do not agree on the potential impact of this missense change (SIFT: \\\"Deleterious\\\"; PolyPhen-2: \\\"Possibly Damaging\\\"; Align-GVGD: \\\"Class C0\\\"). For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.\",\"type\":\"public\"}"],"clinical_assertion_trait_set_id":"SCV000551414","clinical_assertion_observation_ids":["SCV000551414.0"],"trait_set_id":"1198","rcv_accession_id":"RCV000004600"}
