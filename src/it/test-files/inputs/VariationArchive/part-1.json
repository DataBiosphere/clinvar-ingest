The average age of onset is four years. More than 80% of reported individuals manifest spastic gait before the end of the first decade of life. Most persons with early-onset SPG3A have a \"pure\" (\"uncomplicated\") HSP; however, complicated HSP with axonal motor neuropathy and\/or distal amyotrophy with lower motor neuron involvement (Silver syndrome phenotype) have been observed.

However, 9 asymptomatic relatives ranging in age from 13 to 70 years also had the mutation. D'Amico et al.

This mutation was then identified in 3 affected family members and in 3 unaffected family members, consistent with incomplete penetrance. Two of the unaffected carriers were women, and family history indicated that most unaffected women were obligate carriers. These findings were consistent with sex-associated reduced penetrance of this mutation. Varga et al. (2013) identified the same mutation in 1 of 83 Spanish patients with apparent sporadic HSP and in 2 of 28 Russian patients with dominant HSP. Evidence again suggested incomplete penetrance in these families. Varga et al. (2013) also identified a heterozygous c.1244A-G transition, resulting in an arg415-to-gln (R415Q; 606439.0014) substitution, in a Moroccan family with SPG3A and incomplete penetrance. Varga et al. (2013) noted that both the c.1243C-T and c.1244A-G transitions occur at a CpG nucleotide (on the plus and minus strands, respectively) and thus may represent a mutation hotspot due to spontaneous deamination of methylated cytosines.

The arginine residue is highly conserved and there is a moderate physicochemical difference between arginine and tryptophan. This variant is present in population databases (rs119476050, ExAC 0.001%). This variant has been reported in several individuals affected with hereditary spastic paraplegia (PMID: 20932283, 24451228, 19459885, 16401858). This variant has also been reported to segregate with hereditary spastic paraplegia in several families, however, it has been identified in unaffected family members due to adult onset and incomplete penetrance (PMID: 15184642, 24417445, 23483706, 26671083). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 4352). This missense change is located in a region of the ATL1 protein where a significant number of previously reported ATL1 missense mutations are found (PMID: 15596607, 20932283, 25454648, 23483706, 21336785, 19768483). These observations suggest that a previously unreported missense substitution within this region may affect protein function, but experiments have not been done to test this possibility. Algorithms developed to predict the effect of missense changes on protein structure and function do not agree on the potential impact of this missense change (SIFT: \"Deleterious\"; PolyPhen-2: \"Possibly Damaging\"; Align-GVGD: \"Class C0\").
