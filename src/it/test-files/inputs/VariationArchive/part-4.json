The 3-day-old brother had been diagnosed at 30 weeks' gestation with bilaterally dilated posterior and lateral ventricles. He was noted to have tachypnea at birth, but no dysmorphic features or polydactyly. Brain imaging showed ventriculomegaly involving the posterior and temporal horns associated with hypoplasia of the adjacent white matter, hypogenesis of the corpus callosum, and stenogyria\/microgyria in the posterior and medial occipital cortex. Renal ultrasound was normal. The boy's 1-year-old brother was diagnosed with Joubert syndrome based on molar tooth appearance of the pons and thin corpus callosum; he had postaxial polydactyly in all limbs."},"Citation":{"ID":{"@Source":"PubMed","$":"25558065"}},"XRef":{"@DB":"OMIM","@ID":"213300","@Type":"MIM"}}]}},"SimpleAllele":{"GeneList":{"Gene":{"@Symbol":"PDPR"}},"Name":{"$":"PDPR, GLY454CYS"},"VariantType":{"$":"Variation"},"OtherNameList":{"Name":{"@Type":"NonHGVS","$":"GLY454CYS"}},"XRefList":{"XRef":{"@DB":"OMIM","@ID":"617835.0001","@Type":"Allelic variant"}}},"TraitSet":{"@Type":"Disease","Trait":{"@Type":"Disease","Name":{"ElementValue":{"@Type":"Preferred","$":"VARIANT OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE"}}}}},{"@ID":"383036","@DateCreated":"2015-03-09","@DateLastUpdated":"2019-12-28","@SubmissionDate":"2019-11-13","ClinVarSubmissionID":{"@localKey":"13DG0274|Global developmental delay|Typical Joubert syndrome MRI findings"},"ClinVarAccession":{"@Accession":"SCV000196422","@Type":"SCV","@Version":"2","@SubmitterName":"Developmental Genetics Unit,King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Centre","@OrgID":"500184","@OrganizationCategory":"laboratory","@OrgAbbreviation":"DGU-KFSHRC"},"RecordStatus":{"$":"current"},"ReviewStatus":{"$":"no assertion criteria provided"},"Interpretation":{"@DateLastEvaluated":"2019-11-13","Description":{"$":"Likely benign"},"Citation":{"@Type":"general","ID":{"@Source":"PubMed","$":"27894351"}},"Comment":{"$":"In the same patient we were able to identify a likely pathogenic variant for Joubert syndrome (TMEM231 NM_001077418.2: c.665â€11T>C, see PMID: 27894351)."}},"Assertion":{"$":"variation to disease"},"AttributeSet":[{"Attribute":{"@Type":"ModeOfInheritance","$":"Autosomal recessive inheritance"}},{"Attribute":{"@Type":"AssertionMethod","$":"research"}}],"ObservedInList":{"ObservedIn":{"Sample":{"Origin":{"$":"germline"},"Species":{"@TaxonomyId":"9606","$":"human"},"AffectedStatus":{"$":"yes"}},"Method":{"MethodType":{"$":"research"}},"ObservedData":{"Attribute":{"@Type":"Description","$":"not provided"}}}},"SimpleAllele":{"GeneList":{"Gene":{"@Symbol":"PDPR"}},"VariantType":{"$":"Variation"},"AttributeSet":{"Attribute":{"@Type":"HGVS","$":"NM_017990.3:c.1360G>T"}}},"TraitSet":{"@Type":"Finding","Trait":{"@Type":"Disease","XRef":{"@DB":"OMIM phenotypic series","@ID":"PS213300"}}},"Citation":{"@Type":"general","ID":{"@Source":"PubMed","$":"25558065"}}}]},"TraitMappingList":{"TraitMapping":[{"@ClinicalAssertionID":"1940929","@TraitType":"Disease","@MappingType":"Name","@MappingValue":"VARIANT OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE","@MappingRef":"Preferred","MedGen":{"@CUI":"C0431399","@Name":"Joubert syndrome"}},{"@ClinicalAssertionID":"383036","@TraitType":"Disease","@MappingType":"XRef","@MappingValue":"PS213300","@MappingRef":"OMIM phenotypic series","MedGen":{"@CUI":"C0431399","@Name":"Joubert syndrome"}}]}}}}
